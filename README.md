# Artistic Statistics: The Ultimate Plot Parade

Welcome to **Artistic Statistics**, a fully engineered, output-rich Jupyter Notebook built in Google Colab.  
This notebook explores a wide spectrum of statistical plots, charts, dashboards, and model-evaluation visualizations.  
It is ideal for data-science portfolios, teaching, research demonstrations, or creative statistical exploration.

## Features

This project provides a comprehensive collection of visual and analytical tools, including:

- Univariate and bivariate statistical plots  
- 3D scatter plots and parallel coordinates  
- Violin, swarm, strip, count, box, and waffle charts  
- Visualized hypothesis tests: ANOVA, t-test, z-test, chi-squared  
- Classification and regression evaluation dashboards (ROC, PR, confusion matrix, lift curve)  
- Model drift dashboard across time  
- Dataset fingerprinting: entropy, correlation, histograms  
- ICE plots, lift/gain curves, precision/recall/F1 dashboards  
- A fully executable notebook with all outputs pre-rendered for GitHub viewing
